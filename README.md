# flask-codelab
This is a web development codelab using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) made for GWCTV using [Cloud9](https://c9.io).

It's recommended you create a new Python workspace in Cloud9 and clone this repository.

Follow the directions [here](https://blog.rmotr.com/getting-started-with-flask-1389d7dbe285) to setup your environment (but use this git repository instead of what's listed on the site) and install virtualenv and Flask.

After you have your virtual environment running and Flask is installed, run the app.

You can then open ```main.py``` and follow the exercises.
**Asking questions is encouraged if you are stuck!**
